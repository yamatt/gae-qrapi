# QR API
Is an API that allows you to directly create images with QR patterns in them to be generated dynamically through a web interface

## Why
There does exist some Google App Engine based sites that generate QR codes using the Google Chart API but I found a way to do it entirely in Python without the need for external API.

## Status
Early Alpha. Things are likely to change.
